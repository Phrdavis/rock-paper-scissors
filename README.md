# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Let's play rock-paper-scissors :)

This software is basicly a rock-papel-scissors gamy where the player play vs the software program in an simple application.

Having a single screen formulated through the Tkinter module of the Python language, its interface consists of a brief welcome and three buttons, namely rock, paper and scissors.

After the user selects and clicks on the desired button, a legend at the bottom appears informing if there was a victory, defeat or tie and the current score of each round, the score being reset each time the program is opened.

In more technical parts, the program consists of two separate files, "Pedra, Papel e Tesoura.py" and "Modulos.py", which are, respectively, the main file where all the screen settings are then inside the "Application Class( )", distribution of lists for better maintenance of the project in future changes. The images are also called in a list type variable in this main file. The "Modulos.py" file already refers, as the name implies, to a separate file just for storing the modules used in the project.

There is also a folder called "Buttons" where the only four images used within the project are stored, namely "Close.png", "Paper.png", "Stone.png" and "Scissors.png". They are called and allocated in the interface through the main file "Pedra, Papel e Scissors.py".
