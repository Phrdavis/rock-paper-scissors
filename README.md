# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Let's play rock-paper-scissors :)

This software is basicly a rock-papel-scissors gamy where the player play vs the software program in an simple application.

Having a single screen formulated through the Tkinter module of the Python language, its interface consists of a brief welcome and three buttons, namely rock, paper and scissors.

After the user selects and clicks on the desired button, a legend at the bottom appears informing if there was a victory, defeat or tie and the current score of each round, the score being reset each time the program is opened.
